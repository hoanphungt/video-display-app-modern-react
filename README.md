This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is a simple React app following the Modern-React-With-Redux course by Stephen Grider. 

User can use this app to search for youtube videos and then play these videos.

The app can be accessed via this link: https://video-play-by-react.netlify.com/

### How it works

This app allows user to make a simple API request to https://console.developers.google.com/ to get access to Youtube Data API and to load Youtube videos of the search keywords. Finally, it will render a list of found videos on the right side of the screen using a CSS grid layout and the video will be played on the left side.

### How to run the project

* Clone the repository
* Run npm install to install all the project dependencies
* Run npm start or yarn start to start the React app
